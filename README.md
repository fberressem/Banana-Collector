# Banana Collector
Solution to the first project of Udacitys Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree 

### Background Information
In this environment the player (or agent) has to navigate a world populated with yellow and blue bananas. The aim is to collect as many points as possible, where yellow bananas yield **`+1`** points and the blue ones **`-1`**. At every timestep, the player may choose to either go forward (**`0`**), go backward (**`1`**), turn left (**`2`**) or turn right (**`3`**). After a given time the game is over, hence making this task an episodic one. The environment is considered solved when the player achieves an average score of **`+13`** over 100 consecutive episodes.
